## Introduction

The Hex Game with Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning AI project combines the strategic challenges of the Hex game with advanced AI techniques. Hex is a two-player abstract strategy game where the goal is to create a connected path from one side of the hexagonal grid to the other while blocking your opponent's path.

Our project features a well-implemented Hex game and an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to make intelligent moves. It offers both player-versus-player (PvP) and player-versus-AI (PvA) game modes.

## Features

- Play the classic Hex game against a friend or challenge the AI opponent.
- Intelligent AI powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for optimal decision-making.
- User-friendly graphical interface (or text-based interface) for an interactive gaming experience.
- Visual feedback to assist players, including valid move highlighting and AI decision explanations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Hex Game project, follow these steps:

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository to your local machine.
2. [Install Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html) if you haven't already.
3. [Compile and run](#usage) the game.

## Usage

1. Compile and run the game using Prolog.
